# RTFRS - Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition System

The only thing more reliable than your ex's excuses is our face detection system. Just kidding.. We can't guarantee it will recognize your ex, but it can definitely spot all the living humans and animals around you...

## What is RTFRS?

RTFRS stands for **Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition System**. It's like having a unknown person at the door of your life, but instead of checking their Insta and Snap, it checks their true faces. Our system is designed to detect and recognize faces in real-time, ensuring that no one comes to your life without your knowledge.

### But can it recognize my ex?
Ah, the eternal question.. Yeahh RTFRS is a great project in Computer Vision and Machine Learning but it can't guarantee that it'll recognize your ex’s actual face. After all, we’re still waiting for the dataset of their personality.. 🥴💔

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Faster than your friend who says they pick up your calls instantly.
- **Face Recognition**: Remembers faces better than she remembers your birthday (sorry).
- **Dataset**: Just drop your photos in the PHOTOS/Train folder, and that's it.

## Troubleshooting

- **"I can't find my face!"**: Don’t worry; it’s not personal. Just make sure you’re facing the camera and not hiding behind the pain she gave.
- **"Why is it recognizing my dog as my best friend?"**: Well, dogs are better than most humans anyway. ❤️

## Acknowledgments

Shoutout to all the faces out there — thanks for being so recognizable :) And a special thanks to my computer for not crashing... yet..

> **Place the photos of people you want to recognize in the photos folder. No selfies with filters allowed coz we’re looking for the real faces here.**

> **It can only recognize people in your PHOTOS folder, so just don't ask it to identify the Zomato delivery guy unless you have a photo of him.**

> **Hopefully not mistaking your cat for a celebrity... See you until next time...**
