# RTFRS - Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition System

## About

RTFRS (**Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition System**) is a computer vision project designed to detect and recognize faces in real-time.

## What is RTFRS?

RTFRS is built using machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify and recognize faces efficiently. Whether you're using it for personal projects or exploring facial recognition technology, it's a handy tool for real-time face detection. Just drop your photos in the designated folder, and RTFRS will do the rest.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Quick and responsive facial detection.
- **Face Recognition**: Accurately identifies faces in your custom dataset.
- **Easy Setup**: Add photos to the **📁 Faces/Train** folder and get started.

## Troubleshooting

- **Not detecting your face?** Ensure the camera has a clear view.
- **"Why is it recognizing my dog as my best friend?"**: Well, dogs are better than most humans anyway. ❤️

## Acknowledgments

Shoutout to all the faces out there — thanks for being so recognizable :) And a special thanks to my computer for not crashing... yet..

> **Place the photos of people you want to recognize in the photos folder. No selfies with filters allowed coz we’re looking for the real faces here.**

> **It can only recognize people in your PHOTOS folder, so just don't ask it to identify the Zomato delivery guy unless you have a photo of him.**

> **Hopefully not mistaking your cat for a celebrity... See you until next time...**
